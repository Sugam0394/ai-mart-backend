## Models

### User Model
- Fields: `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (`user` or `admin`)
- Password hashing
- JWT generation for authentication

### Admin Model
- Same as User model but role is `admin`

### Tool Model
- Fields: `title`, `description`, `category`, `createdBy`, `averageRating`, `numberOfReviews`, `price`, `link`, `tags`
- Relational reference to `User` who created the tool

### Review Model
- Fields:
  - `user` → ObjectId of the User
  - `tool` → ObjectId of the Tool being reviewed
  - `rating` → Number
  - `comment` → String
- **Functionality**:
  - Each user can post one review per tool.
  - After creation/deletion, the tool’s **averageRating** and **numberOfReviews** are automatically updated.
  - Admin can fetch all reviews of a tool.
- **Sample Code**:

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const reviewSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true },
    tool: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Tool", required: true },
    rating: { type: Number, required: true },
    comment: { type: String },
}, { timestamps: true });

// Update tool rating after review is created/deleted
reviewSchema.statics.updateToolRating = async function(toolId) {
    const reviews = await this.find({ tool: toolId });
    const avgRating = reviews.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.rating, 0) / reviews.length || 0;
    await Tool.findByIdAndUpdate(toolId, {
        averageRating: avgRating,
        numberOfReviews: reviews.length,
    });
};
